The atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on EKG done on 11/02/07 and this EKG is not significantly changed from the most recent one. Echocardiogram results as above. Chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.1. Fall assessment as per dr Z and dr XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin. Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol. 2. The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis. 3. Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade. I would defer to her usual cardiologist dr X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification. I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well. 4. Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol. 5.

She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by dr X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report. One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin. Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk. If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year. I would defer that decision to dr Z and dr XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate\n",
